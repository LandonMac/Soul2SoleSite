				The 2nd annual Soul 2 Sole: SHOOT FOR THE STARS 5K CHALLENGE is taking place at the Aviation Challenge
				Campus located near
				<b>the Space & Rocket Center in
					Huntsville, AL.</b> The 3.1 mile course is a combination of trails, workouts, obstacles & rugged
				terrain
				sure to test all fitness levels!
				Not sure if you can perform the required tasks?
				Don't worry! Each participant will have the opportunity to bypass any obstacle without a penalty.
			</p>
			<p>
				This race will be timed. Awards will be given to Age Division Winners (13-17, 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50+)
				and
				the fastest team (Minimum 5 Participants).
				As a participant it will be your GOAL to accomplish the run, workout and terrain without knowing what’s
				ahead.
				To win your division all challenges must be completed without any modifications.
				Once registered, we will be sending out a link to designate your team name and the people on your team.

				The purpose for not knowing what is awaiting for you in the race is to accept challenges equivalent to
				real
				life circumstances that students in the School of Specialized Learners at Lindsay Lane Christian Academy
				and their
				families face on a day to day basis. We encourage all participants to step out of their comfort zones
				and tackle these obstacles.

				Proceeds from the race will be donated to the School of Specialized Learners at Lindsay Lane Christian
				Academy.
				This run will be a rain or shine event.
				The purpose of the <b>School Specialized Learners at Lindsay Lane Christian Academy</b> is to provide an
				opportunity for students who are considered “unique learners” due to an intellectual or physical
				disability to receive an
				inclusive education along-side their typical peers. The school is designed to remove barriers and
				deliver exceptional educational
				services to children with special needs in an inclusive educational setting. The program will build on a
				successful
				pilot program and target children with intellectual and/or physical disabilities, from preschool to
				elementary age, who are
				considered differently-abled learners. While these children learn in non-traditional ways, there are
				many benefits to incorporating
				these students into classrooms with traditional learners in their age group.
